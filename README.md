EagleLibraries
==============

Here are some of my self created eagle libraries.
Feel free to use them in any of your open source projects.

arduino.lbr
-------------------------

In this library I have prepared the following devices:

* MEGASHIELD: This is a template for a shield which fits to an Arduino MEGA. The 6-Pin icsp header in the center of the board is missing. There are two packages available one with labels on each pin and one without any labels.
* MINI_MEGASHIELD: This is a template for a shield which fits to the pins 14-53 and A8-A15 these are the pins which are still free after a shield for a standart arduino has been mounted to an Arduino MEGA. There are two packages available one with labels on each pin and one without any labels.

measure.lbr
-------------------------

In this library I have prepared the following devices:

* RULER: This device contains a ruler with 100mm and 200mm.
* SQUARE: This device contains a square with a edge length of 100mm and also a 4Inch version.

con.lbr

This library is a varous mixture of connectors sorted by the pincount
